# Roadmap

This is my personal roadmap for learning web development â€” specifically the front-end. This is heavily based on [Web Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap), but may deviate from the original as I add more specificity.

---

_To Do:_

- Test Build process for gh-pages deployment
- Create main page with checked/unchecked boxes to track progress
- Create documentation
